# my-journey
Hello.
This is my first legitimate project managed on GitHub. It will be about my programming journey, and maybe a little bit about myself.
I will be experimenting and messing around with a lot of features, so many commits may look strange after a while.

I want to include:
- self intro, maybe
- a timeline of my journey â€” from Dec 2019 to present day
- within that timeline, paths or links(?) to writeups or reflections on my experiences doing these tasks / learning these topics

I will almost definitely develop new ideas along the way, so this list is in no way exhaustive.
I sincerely hope this will turn out to be a functional and beautiful website.
